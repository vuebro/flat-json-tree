# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Maintain and update the flat-json-tree library, a Vue 3 composable for manipulating JSON tree objects by transforming them into flat arrays for easier operations.

## Key Knowledge
- Project: `@vuebro/flat-json-tree` version 2.1.26 (as of latest update)
- Technology: TypeScript library with Vue 3 reactivity system
- Architecture: Vue 3 composable function that transforms JSON trees into flat arrays with computed properties (branch, index, next, parent, prev, siblings)
- Build: Uses TypeScript compiler (tsc) via `npm run build`
- Lint: Uses ESLint via `npm run lint` with auto-fix capability
- Main file: `src/index.ts` contains the primary implementation
- The library allows standard array operations on tree structures while preserving hierarchical relationships

## Recent Actions
- Successfully updated project dependencies with `npm update --save`
- Incremented package version twice using `npm version patch` (from 2.1.24 to 2.1.26)
- Ran linting with auto-fix (`npm run lint -- --fix`) successfully
- Completed build process (`npm run build`) with TypeScript compilation
- No errors encountered during any of these operations

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Update dependencies to latest compatible versions
2. [DONE] Increment patch version (completed twice)
3. [DONE] Run linting with auto-fix
4. [DONE] Complete build process
5. [TODO] Continue with any additional development, testing, or release tasks as needed
6. [TODO] Prepare for publishing the new version if deployment is the next step
